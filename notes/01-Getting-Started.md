![MongoDB](./images/00-mongodb-logo.jpg "MongoDB")

This hands-on workshop is designed to familiarize you with all aspects of MongoDB, from deploying a cluster, to loading data to creating services to access that data. 

This workshop is divided into two parts, with Part 1 focusing on Atlas, our fully managed database service, and Part 2 focusing on Stitch, our serverless application platorm. Each part contains several lab exercises. Don’t worry about completing all lab exercises in this sitting. The free environment you create in this lab will be yours forever.
