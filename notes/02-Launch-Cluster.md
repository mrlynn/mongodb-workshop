## Launching an Atlas Cluster

Create an Account or Log In to Atas
We’ll be using MongoDB Atlas, our fully managed MongoDB-as-a-service, for this workshop. Go to [https://cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and either create a new account or log into an existing account you may have previously created.

Leave the remaing options set to the defaults and skip down to the bottom section where you can set the Cluster Name.

Set the Cluster Name - This can be whatever you like.
